    <h1>first ever car crash</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The first known car accident occurred in 1891 in Ohio, involving one of the earliest gasoline-powered vehicles. The driver was James Lambert, an inventor and automobile pioneer who was testing his newly developed gasoline-powered buggy. 
    The car, at that time, was a far cry from the sophisticated automobiles we drive today. It was a three-horsepower vehicle with steel wheels and a top speed of around five miles per hour.
    While driving his buggy in Ohio City, Lambert lost control of the vehicle. He struck a tree root in the road, causing the car to veer off course and collide with a post. While both Lambert and his passenger, James Swoveland, escaped with only minor injuries, this incident marked the very first recorded automobile accident. 
    While seemingly insignificant compared to modern-day collisions, this minor car accident set the stage for the era of road safety regulations and vehicle innovation.</p>
